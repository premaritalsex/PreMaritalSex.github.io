        Premarital sex is sexual activity practiced by persons who are unmarried. The prevalence of pre-marital sex has increased in both developed and developing countries. In some cultures, the significance of premarital sex has traditionally been related to the concept of virginity. However, unlike virginity, premarital sex can refer to more than one occasion of sexual activity or more than one sex partner. There are cultural differences as to whether and in which circumstances premarital sex is socially acceptable or tolerated. Social attitudes to premarital sex have changed over time as has the prevalence of premarital sex in various societies. Social attitudes to premarital sex can include issues such as virginity, sexual morality, extramarital unplanned pregnancy, legitimacy besides other issues. Premarital sex may take place in a number of situations. For example, it may take place as casual sex, for example, with at least one participant seeking to experience sex; it may take place between a couple living together in a long-term relationship without marriage; for a betrothed couple engaging in sexual activity before their anticipated marriage; and many other situations are possible.

                <p style="text-align:justify">Sexual intercourse is one of the most amazing experiences of life. It is a great tool that bonds couples. Powerful as sexual intimacy may be, though, it also has serious destructive capacity. The destructive impact of sexual intercourse is prominent in the realm of premarital sex.  Casual daters may feel all right to have sex even on the first date. But for those who are looking for a meaningful relationship that is lasting, premarital sex is starting your relationship off on the wrong footing and faulty foundation.<br><br>

Many dating partners have tried to grow their relationship on the wrong notion that sexual intercourse is love.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  Love is as far apart from sexual intercourse as love and hate is opposite of each other.  You do not need love to get sex and you do not need sex to get love.  Many gullible girls and sometimes boys have been cajoled, intimidated or deceived into believing that sexual intercourse is the same as love. Sexual intercourse and premarital sex is even called love-making. It may interest you to know that sexual intercourse is not even a sign of love.<br><br>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> and lawful marriage relationship.  It is a shame filled act outside marriage, even for those who try to feel or state otherwise.  The bonding effect of sexual intercourse is not possible outside marriage.  The experiences of many clearly point to this conclusion.
There are many other reasons why you should avoid premarital sex.  These include but not limited to the following:<br>
Premarital sex reduces the value of the relationship – building a relationship with opposite sex is a delicate business. The effort requires consistent focus on the building of the foundational elements such as friendship, trust, understanding, etc.  Premarital sex serves as a cog in the wheel of progress of this all important venture. It packages it as being cheap and the only reason the relationship was contracted in the first place. Sexual intercourse is one of the worst reasons for being in any relationship.  Sexual intercourse no matter how thrilling cannot enhance or sustain a relationship.  In fact, in most cases, premarital scuttles a relationships and destroys the possibility of it becoming meaningful.<br><br>

Premarital sex denies dating or courtship partners the chance of properly studying their different background – dating and courtship are special periods in the relationship between the sexes.  It is the period when both have opportunity to know the real stuff each is made of.  At the initial stage of the male-female relationship, there are pretended courtesies and formalities intended to create impressions.  But as the dating relationship progresses, it is possible for the observant dater to know the stuff each other is made of so that issues of compatibility could be settled.  The moment, however, premarital sex gets in the way, studying gives way to feeling and all learning abilities vanish.  One of the things that could warn those who are involved in premarital sex that their studying opportunity has been short-circuited is the fact that each meeting begins or ends in a sexual intercourse which becomes more and more meaningless each time.  This preponderance usually results from the soul’s yearning to learn about the other person through the sexual act.  Because this is not possible, this is why people date for ridiculous long periods without making up their minds to continue or leave the relationship. In this kind of learning situation, instead of knowing, the parties get confused.<br><br>

Premarital sex cheapens the essence of this special gift from God called sexual intimacy –as noted at the onset, sexual intimacy is a beautiful thing within the bonds of matrimony.  According to The Family: A proclamation to the world issued by the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve Apostles of  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ‘sexual relationship between a man and a woman legally and lawfully wedded is ordained of God’. The experiences of many who have obtained sexual intimacy outside holy matrimony have shown that they felt cheap, used and foolish.  No matter however arts, literature and other media describe sexual intercourse, the moment of truth which people must go back to after the theatricals are over, has only one bitter truth – those who have engaged in premarital sex have felt the three negative emotions of being cheap, used and foolish and possibly more worst emotions as a result.<br><br>

The target of dating and courtship partners should be to grow the relationship to focus on the essential qualities a marriage needs to solidify it when it happens.  This is called the foundation for joyful relationships.  Working through this foundation enables dating and courtship partners to take responsibilities for the future they plan together by being able to communicate as two people who are committed to building an eternity together.<br><br>

The wonderful opportunity to study your partner, know what his or her shortcomings are, understand his or her moods, attitudes as well as strength and weaknesses should not be sacrificed on the altar of sexual aggrandizement which is the only worth of premarital sex.
